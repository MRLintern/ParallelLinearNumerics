# Results
* This is a sample of the results obtained.
* The `SOR` method uses a `relaxation factor` of `1.7`.
* This should be varied between `0 < w < 2`.

## Convergence Data Set
* `Convergence_Data.csv`.
* Convergence rates measured in (milli) seconds.
* This is a collated data set of all the algorithms.
* Run the `Python` script to display a graph of the collated data.
