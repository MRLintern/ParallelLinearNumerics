# Introduction
* This fould contains updated software which tests a range of `relaxation factors` between `[0, 2]`.
* The `Parallel Jacobi` and `Parallel Gauss-Seidel` methods are left unchanged.
* However, the files generated for these methods do mention a `relaxation factor` of `1.0`; this doesn't the methods.

## Results
* `CSV` files for each `relaxation factor` are generated.
* You will also find a `collated data set` which consists of all methods, along with the `convergence rates` corresponding to their `relaxation factor`.
